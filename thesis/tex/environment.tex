Classic synthesis aims to derive an agent from a specification which handles
all possible inputs. Interpretating this setting of synthesis as a game where
the agent tries to fulfill the specification while the environment tries to
provide a behaviour which provokes a mistake of the agent (i.e. an execution
which does not satisfy the specification) we consider the environment to be
antagonistic. We use \ac{MDP} to model an environment that is probabilistic
rather than antagonistic but not indifferent to the actions of the agent. Thus,
the environment interacts with the agent but is not deliberately acting
maliciously. The following definitions follow \cite{RandAutoInfTrees}:
