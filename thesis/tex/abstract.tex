  In this thesis we introduce and examine \aclp*{WDTA}, a class of tree
  automata for infinite trees that incorporate a notion of weighting on the
  individual paths of their runs and an aspect of alternation. We focus on
  their strength to model other probabilistic systems. Inspired by these
  results we obtain for specifications, given as \aclp*{PBA} with almost-sure
  acceptance, decision procedures for deterministic strategy synthesis in
  \aclp*{POMDP} and antagonistic environments.
