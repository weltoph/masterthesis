\chapter{Word Automata}
It is well established to rely on finite automata to recognize languages of 
infinite objects, e.g. trees or words \cite{LangAutoLog}. In this chapter we
recall some known results for languages of infinite words and infinite trees 
(in the next chapter). These languages of words are used in Chapter 
\ref{chapter:synthesis} to define specifications for synthesis problems.
