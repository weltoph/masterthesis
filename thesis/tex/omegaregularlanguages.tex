\section{$\omega$-regular Languages}
\label{sec:wordautomata}
Following \cite{LangAutoLog} (resp. \cite[Chapter 1]{AutoLogInfGames} for the
Parity-condition below) we introduce word automata with the following
structural definition
\begin{definition}[Word Automaton]
  We define a word automaton as
  $\mathcal{A} = \tuple{Q, \Sigma, q_{0}, \Delta}$ where
  $Q$ is a set of states, $\Sigma$ a finite alphabet, $q_{0}\in Q$ is the
  initial state and $\Delta\subseteq Q\times\Sigma\times Q$ is the transition
  relation. We define some associated notions as follows:
  \begin{description}
    \item [Run]
      For a word $\alpha = \alpha_{0}\alpha_{1}\dots\in\Sigma^{\omega}$ we call
      a sequence $\pi = \pi_{0}\pi_{1}\dots \in Q^{\omega}$ a run of
      $\mathcal{A}$ on $\alpha$ if $\pi_{0} = q_{0}$ and for every
      $i\in\mathbb{N}$ holds that
      $\tuple{\pi_{i}, \alpha_{i}, \pi_{i+1}}\in\Delta$
    \item [Determinism]
      We call $\mathcal{A}$ deterministic if for every pair $q\in Q$ and
      $\sigma\in\Sigma$ the set
      $\set{p\in Q\mid\tuple{q,\sigma,p}\in\Delta}$ has at most one
      element.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}
This allows for automata to yield for an input word a corresponding run, i.e.
attach onto the input word a word of states that is consistent with the
structure of the automaton. These attached words of states are runs of word
automata on words and are categorized as accepting or non-accepting by the
following conditions:
\begin{definition}[Acceptance Conditions]
  For a word automaton $\mathcal{A} = \tuple{Q, \Sigma, q_{0}, \Delta}$ we
  define different acceptance conditions. For this we define for a run
  $\pi = \pi_{0}\pi_{1}\dots\in Q^{\omega}$ the operator
  $\Inf$ as the set of states that occur infinitely in a run, i.e.
  \begin{equation*}
    \Inf(\pi) = \set{q\in Q\middle| \text{ there are infinitely many }
    i\in\mathbb{N} \text{ s.t. } \pi_{i} = q}.
  \end{equation*}
  With this notion we define the following acceptance conditions:
  \begin{description}
    \item [Büchi] A Büchi condition is defined by a set of final states
      $F\subseteq Q$ and we call a run $\pi$ accepting if
      $\Inf(\pi)\cap F\neq\emptyset$.
    \item [Muller] Muller conditions are given as a family of state sets, i.e.
      $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{F}$. A run $\pi$ is called accepting if
      $\Inf(\pi)\in\mathcal{F}$.
    \item [Rabin] This acceptance condition is represented by a set of pairs\\
      $\Omega = \set{\tuple{E_{0}, F_{0}}, \dots, \tuple{F_{n}, E_{n}}}$ and we
      call a run $\pi$ accepting if there is an $i$ s.t.
      $\Inf(\pi)\cap F_{i}\neq\emptyset$ but $\Inf(\pi)\cap E_{i} = \emptyset$.
    \item [Parity] This condition is defined by a function
      $\parity:Q\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. We call a run $\pi$ accepting if the
      maximum of the set $\parity(\Inf(\pi))$, which describes the pointwise
      application of $\parity$ to the set $\Inf(\pi)$, is even (note that due
      to the finiteness of $Q$, $\Inf(\pi)$ is finite as well and thus the
      maximum of $\parity(\Inf(\pi))$ exists).
  \end{description}
  For any of these objects $\Gamma\in\set{F, \mathcal{F}, \set{\tuple{E_{0},
  F_{0}},\dots,\tuple{E_{n}, F_{n}}}, \parity}$ we use $\Acc(\Gamma)$ to refer
  to the accepted language. If necessary we use subscripts to $\Acc$ to make 
  the interpretation of its argument clear.
\end{definition}\fxfatal{find fitting reference for prefix-independence}
Note that by the nature of these acceptance conditions, namely that acceptance
solely depends on those states that occur infinitely often, the acceptance is
at any moment determined by the \enquote{future}. We call this
\emph{prefix-independence} and formerly capture this by stating that every
$\alpha = \alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\dots\in\Acc(\Gamma)$ implies that for any $i>0$
also $\alpha_{i}\alpha_{i+1}\dots\in\Acc(\Gamma)$ (again we let $\Gamma$ be a
meta variable, ranging over the described finite representations of acceptance
conditions). We categorize word automata by their acceptance condition and if
they are deterministic. Thus, we call - for example - a word automaton
$\mathcal{A}$ equipped with a Büchi-condition a \ac{NBA} or respectively
\ac{DBA} if $\mathcal{A}$ is deterministic. And analogously we obtain word
automata for Muller-, Rabin- and Parity-conditions and corresponding
acronyms.

\acuse{DPA}

The theory to these - so called - $\omega$-automata is well
established. We recall some of the central results and provide proofs since it
allows us to define auxiliary structures in a simple context which we use later
on in more involved settings. Our arguments follow, in some condensed and
occasionally less formal form, \cite[Chapter 1]{AutoLogInfGames}. We start with
\begin{example}
  We consider the language $\mathcal{L}$ as the set of all infinite
  words over the alphabet $\set{a,b}$ such that $a$ occurs only finitely often.
  This language can be accepted using e.g. an \ac{NBA} $\mathcal{A}$ as defined 
  in Figure \ref{fig:finaautomata}. The argument that this \ac{NBA} accepts 
  $\mathcal{L}$ is as follows: The non-determinism allows the automaton to 
  \enquote{guess} one moment from which on no more $a$ is read. For any word in 
  $\mathcal{L}$ such a moment exists and can therefore be correctly guessed 
  while every word that is accepted by $\mathcal{A}$ needs to move to its
  $q_{F}$ state and it is straightforward to argue that no more $a$ can occur
  afterwards.

  Alternatively, we can accept $\mathcal{L}$ by a \ac{DPA} $\mathcal{B}_{P}$,
  \ac{DRA} $\mathcal{B}_{R}$, \ac{DMA}
  $\mathcal{B}_{M}$ which all share the same structure as defined in Figure
  \ref{fig:finaautomata}. We use the different acceptance conditions to model
  the same restriction, namely that $q_{a}$ only occurs finitely often while
  $q_{b}$ occurs infinitely often.
  \begin{description}
    \item [$\mathcal{B}_{P}$] We define $\parity(q_{a}) = 1$ and
      $\parity(q_{b}) = 0$, thus - since the parity of $q_{a}$ trumps the
      parity of $q_{b}$ but is odd - $q_{a}$ must only occur finitely often.
    \item [$\mathcal{B}_{R}$] Here we define $\set{\tuple{E = \set{q_{a}},
      F = \set{q_{b}}}}$, which models the restriction very clearly by
      explicitly stating which states are \enquote{good} respectively
      \enquote{bad} to visit infinitely often.
    \item [$\mathcal{B}_{M}$] The acceptance family is fixed with
      $\mathcal{F} = \set{\set{q_{b}}}$, thus the only way to achieve an
      accepting run is to eventually stay in $q_{b}$.
  \end{description}
  It is noteworthy that all these conditions are essentially modelling the
  abscence of a state. This is occasionally done by defining a set of states
  that must only be visited finitely often. Such an acceptance condition is
  called a co-Büchi-condition with $F = \set{q_{a}}$ and describes the inverse
  of a Büchi-condition (hence the name).
 
  Note that on the other hand we used a structural way to model this negative
  restriction for $\mathcal{A}$.
  \label{ex:fina}
\end{example}
\begin{drawing}
  \caption{In (a) an \ac{NBA} is illustrated which accepts the language of
  words with finitely many $a$. The states of the Büchi-condition $F$ are
  marked by doubling the outline, i.e. $F = \set{q_{F}}$.
  In (b) a deterministic automaton is defined which simply moves to $q_{a}$
  (resp. $q_{b}$) if an $a$ (resp. $b$) is read (starting in $q_{a}$).}
  \label{fig:finaautomata}
  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{tikz/fina-automaton.pdf}}
\end{drawing}
We radically compress the rich theory of $\omega$-automata by stating the 
following
\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Theorem 1.19, Theorem 1.24, Section 1.3.2,Theorem 3.2]{AutoLogInfGames}
  The class of recognizable languages coincides for \acp{NBA}, \acp{NMA},
  \acp{DMA}, \acp{NRA}, \acp{DRA}, \acp{NPA} and \acp{DPA} and is called
  $\omega$-regular languages. \acp{DBA} are strictly less expressive.
  \label{thm:omegaregularexp}
\end{theorem}
Additionally, we will restrict the proof to some of its arguments, namely one
which allows us to introduce the concept of \acp{LAR} and some that are easily
explained and also later on referred to.
\begin{proof}
  Firstly, we provide an argument to show that \acp{DBA} are less expressive.
  Consider again $\mathcal{L}$ from Example \ref{ex:fina} and the following
  argument: the deterministic nature of any \ac{DBA} $\mathcal{A}$ yields one
  possible run for every word of $\mathcal{A}$. This means that words with
  common finite prefixes share common finite prefixes of their individual runs.
  Assume to have one \ac{DBA} $\mathcal{A}$ which accepts $\mathcal{L}$ and 
  consider the following family of words with common prefixes
  \begin{equation*}
    b^{\omega}, b^{n_{0}}ab^{\omega}, b^{n_{0}}ab^{n_{1}}ab^{\omega}, \dots,
  \end{equation*}
  where every $n_{i}$ is chosen such that the unique run in $\mathcal{A}$
  just visited a state in $F$ (which needs to happen since every element of
  this word-family is in $\mathcal{L}$ and therefore accepted by $\mathcal{A}$).
  Thus, by iterating \enquote{sliding in} $a$ after a visit in $F$ we construct 
  a word which is accepted but contains infinitely many $a$ contradicting that
  $\mathcal{A}$ actually recognizes $\mathcal{L}$.

  Secondly, we argue that Muller-, Rabin- and Parity-conditions are
  equally expressive. Therefore, we initially consider that all deterministic
  automata are non-deterministic automata which do not use their
  non-determinism. Furthermore it is easy to see, that Rabin- and
  Parity-conditions are captured by Muller-conditions by enumerating all
  $\Inf$-sets that satisfy the corresponding conditions. In a second step we
  show that \acp{NMA} can be translated to \acp{NPA} as well as \acp{NRA}. This
  translation makes use of the following construct:
  \begin{definition}[Latest Appearance Record]
    For a finite state set $Q$ define the set of permutations of elements in
    $Q$ as $\perm(Q)\subseteq Q^{\size{Q}}$ and
    \begin{equation*}
      \lar(Q) = \set{\interval{w,h}\mid w\in\perm(Q)\text{ and }1\leq
      h\leq\size{Q}}
    \end{equation*}
    Additionally we define an update function
    $\up:\lar(Q)\times Q\rightarrow\lar(Q)$ with
    \begin{equation*}
      \up(\interval{q_{1}\dots q_{n},h}, q)
      = \interval{qq_{1}\dots q_{i-1}q_{i+1}\dots q_{n},i}
      \text{ for the unique }i\text{ s.t. }q=q_{i}
    \end{equation*}
    and conclude with auxillary definitions of
    \begin{description}
      \item [Hit-set] for $\ell = \interval{q_{1}\dots q_{n},h}$ we call
        $\set{q_{1},\dots,q_{h}}$ the hit-set of $\ell$,
      \item [State partition] the states of $\lar(Q)$ can be partitioned into
        those elements that resulted from an update by $\up(\cdot, q)$ for
        every $q\in Q$. We define 
        $\lar(Q)\interval{q} = \set{\interval{q_{1}\dots q_{n}}\in\lar(Q)\mid
          q_{1} = q} = \set{\up(\ell, q):\ell\in\lar(Q)}$.
    \end{description}
  \end{definition}
  For a word $q_{1}q_{2}\dots\in Q^{\omega}$ we can obtain one associated
  sequence of elements in $\lar(Q)$ by picking one arbitrary starting value
  $\ell_{1}$ and successively applying the update operation, i.e.
  $\ell_{1}\ell_{2}\dots\in\lar(Q)^{\omega}$ with
  $\ell_{i+1} = \up(\ell_{i},q_{i})$ for all $i>0$. We can now state that
  $\Inf(q_{1}q_{2}\dots)$ moves to the beginning of the $\lar(Q)$ elements in
  the associated sequence
  \begin{lemma}
    \cite[Lemma 1.21]{AutoLogInfGames}
    $\Inf(q_{1}q_{2}\dots) = F$ if and only if from one $k>0$ the hit-set of
    all $\ell_{i}$ for $i>k$ is a subset of $F$ and there are infinitely many
    $i>k$ s.t. the hit-set of $\ell_{i}$ coincides with $F$.
    \label{lem:larhitset}
  \end{lemma}
  This Lemma induces that the sequence of hit-sets stabilises to the set
  $\Inf(q_{1}q_{2}\dots)$. Thus, $q_{1}q_{2}\dots$ satisfies a Muller condition
  $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if the hit-sets stabilises to an element of
  $\mathcal{F}$. This can be captured within a parity condition by associating
  to $\ell = \interval{p_{1}\dots p_{n},h}$ with hit-set
  $H = \set{p_{1},\dots,p_{h}}$ a parity condition
  \begin{equation*}
    \parity(\ell) = \begin{cases}
      2\cdot\size{H} &\text{ if }H\in\mathcal{F}\\
      2\cdot\size{H}-1 &\text{ if }H\notin\mathcal{F}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  Thus, winning hit-sets do have an even and losing hit-sets do have an odd
  parity and notably the highest parity value is even if and only if
  $\Inf(q_{1}q_{2}\dots)\in\mathcal{F}$. Therefore, we can define a \ac{NPA}
  that has as state set the elements $\lar(Q)$ and mirrors the transitions of
  the original \ac{NMA} through the application of the update function, i.e.
  for every $\tuple{q, a, p}$ there is a corresponding 
  $\tuple{\ell_{q}, a, \up(\ell_{q}, p)}$ for every $\ell_{q}\in\lar(Q)$ that
  is produced by $\up(\cdot,q)$. Every run in the \ac{NPA} can be translated 
  back to a run in the original \ac{NMA} and vice versa and by Lemma 
  \ref{lem:larhitset} and the definition of $\parity$ we obtain the acceptance
  equivalence of both runs. We close this argument by stating that
  any Parity-condition can be expressed by a Rabin-condition as follows:
  we define for every occuring even parity $k\in\parity(Q)$ a pair
  $\tuple{E_{k}, F_{k}}$ where $F_{k} = \parity^{-1}(k)$ and
  $E_{k} = \cup_{p>k}\parity^{-1}(p)$; hence, an accepting run regarding the
  Parity-condition satisfies the pair associated with the highest parity and
  on the other hand, any run that is accepting by the Rabin-condition, namely
  by the pair $\tuple{E_{k}, F_{k}}$, has  $k$ as the highest parity which is
  the even witness rendering the run accepting.

  Thirdly, we conclude by stating (without proof) that for every \acp{NMA} 
  exists an equivalent \ac{NBA} and - more easily - the other way around
  \begin{theorem}
    \cite[Theorem 1.10]{AutoLogInfGames}
    For every \acp{NBA} exists an equivalent \ac{NMA} and for every \acp{NMA}
    exists an equivalent \ac{NBA}.
  \end{theorem}
  And also we avoid the lengthy technicalities of determinization of an
  \ac{NBA} by simply stating
  \begin{theorem}
    \cite[Theorem 3.6]{AutoLogInfGames}
    For every \acp{NBA} exists an equivalent \ac{DMA}.
  \end{theorem}
\end{proof}

Finally, we state here
\fxfatal{effective construction for union is not mentioned in reference}
\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Consequence from Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.24]{AutoLogAndInfGames}
  The $\omega$-regular languages form a Boolean-algebra, i.e. are closed under
  union, intersection and negation. The transformations can be effectively
  constructed.
  \label{thm:omegaregboolean}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The proof consist of operations that take two (respectively one) word 
  automata and construct a word automaton that accepts the union, intersection 
  or respectively the negation. Beginning with the union, we make use of
  non-determinism such that the resulting automaton guesses at the beginning in
  which language the word is and simulates the \enquote{correct} automaton. The 
  closure under intersection makes use of a natural product construction, 
  namely
  \begin{definition}
    For $\mathcal{A}_{1} = \tuple{Q, \Sigma, q_{0}, \Delta}$ and
    $\mathcal{A}_{2} = \tuple{P, \Sigma, p_{0}, \nabla}$ we define
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal{A}_{1}\otimes\mathcal{A}_{2} = \tuple{Q\times P, \Sigma, 
      \tuple{q_{0}, p_{0}}, \Delta\otimes\nabla}
    \end{equation*}
    with
    \begin{equation*}
      \Delta\otimes\nabla = 
      \set{\tuple{\tuple{q^{1}, p^{1}}, \sigma, 
      \tuple{q^{2}, p^{2}}}: \tuple{q^{1},\sigma, q^{2}}\in\Delta, 
      \tuple{p^{1},\sigma, p^{2}}\in\nabla}.
    \end{equation*}
  \end{definition}
  Every run in this product can be separated into runs in $\mathcal{A}_{1}$ and
  $\mathcal{A}_{2}$. W.l.o.g. we can assume the original two automata to be
  equipped with Muller-conditions $\mathcal{F}_{1},\mathcal{F}_{2}$ and define
  for the product automaton the Muller-condition 
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{F} = \set{\set{\tuple{q^{1}, p^{1}},\dots,\tuple{q^{1}, p^{1}}}:
    \set{q^{1},\dots,q^{n}}\in\mathcal{F}_{1},
    \set{p^{1},\dots,p^{n}}\in\mathcal{F}_{2}}.
  \end{equation*}
  Hence the run in the product automaton is accepted if and only if the 
  associated runs in the original automata are accepted.

  The closure under negation can be expressed very elegantly (cp. 
  \cite[Transformation 1.25.]{AutoLogInfGames}). W.l.o.g. we consider the 
  original automaton to be a \ac{DPA}. By setting a new Parity-condition with
  $\parity'(q) = \parity(q) + 1$ and keeping the original structure we exchange
  non-accepting and accepting runs and therefore obtain a structural equivalent 
  \ac{DPA} that precisely accepts the complement of the original automaton.
\end{proof}
