The synthesis for \acp{PBA} is - in our current context - understood as the
following question:
\begin{definition}[PBA-Synthesis Question]
  For a given \ac{MDP} $\mathcal{M}$ where the actions are a finite set $O$ and
  a \ac{PBA} $\mathcal{A}$ over the alphabet $S_{\mathcal{M}}\times O$ we want
  to find a strategy that generates for every history
  $\tuple{s_{0}, o_{0}}\dots\tuple{s_{n-1},o_{n-1}}s_{n}$ an
  $o_{n}$ such that the measure induced by the probability of projection to the
  first component induced by $\mathcal{M}$ $\mu$ of those words that lay within
  $L(\mathcal{A})$ is 1.
\end{definition}
Considering a qualitative acceptance condition on $\mathcal{A}$ we can answer
this question positively. We construct a \ac{WDTA} where the accepted trees are
precisely those that encode such a strategy and use the emptiness game to
actually synthesis a strategy (or prove its non-existence). This cumulates to
\begin{theorem}[Qualitative PBA Synthesis]
  The synthesis question of an environment $\mathcal{M}$ and a specification
  provided as \ac{PBA} $\mathcal{A}$ with a qualitative acceptance condition
  can be decided.
\end{theorem}
