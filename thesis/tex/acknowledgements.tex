  I want to thank Dr.~LÃ¶ding for supervising this thesis and offering helpful
  advice throughout its creation. As for my Bachelor's thesis, Prof.~Katoen
  offers his aditional supervision for which I am grateful. For helpful
  discussions I am also indebted to Sebastian Junges and Benjamin Kaminski.

  On a personal note, I extend my gratitude to my parents for their constant
  support, my siblings for providing a valuable change of perspective every now
  and then and a few fellow students: Karla, Johannes, Simon, Kerstin and Nick.
