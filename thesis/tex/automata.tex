\chapter{On words and trees}
It is well established to rely on finite automata to recognize languages of
infinite objects, e.g. trees or words \cite{LangAutoLog}. In this chapter we
recall some known results for languages of infinite words and infinite trees.
Furthermore, building upon the work in \cite{RandAutoInfTrees}, we introduce
and examine a new class of tree automata, called \aclp{WDTA}. In Chapter
\ref{chapter:synthesis} we use these class of automata to (re-)prove some
synthesis results in the context of probabilistic environments.
