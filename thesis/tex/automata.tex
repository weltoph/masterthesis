\chapter{Word Automata}
It is well established to rely on finite automata to recognize languages of 
infinite objects, e.g. trees or words \cite{LangAutoLog}. In this chapter we
recall some known results for languages of infinite words and infinite trees 
(in the next chapter). These languages of words are used in Chapter 
\ref{chapter:synthesis} to define specifications for synthesis problems.

\chapter{Tree Automata}
In this chapter we introduce, based upon the work in \cite{RandAutoInfTrees}, 
a new class of tree automata, called \aclp{WDTA}. In Chapter 
\ref{chapter:synthesis} we use these class of automata to (re-)prove some 
synthesis results in the context of probabilistic environments.
