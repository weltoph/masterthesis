Concludingly, the results of this thesis are twofold. Mainly, we
introduced \acp{WDTA} as a class of automata on infinite trees that incorporate
the concept of weighted paths and alternation. Its close connection to
\acp{POMDP} and \acp{PBA} unveiled positive and negative results for the
decidability of emptiness problems. More importantly, \acp{WDTA} have proven an
interesting model by their expressiveness and complex nature.

Secondly, \acp{WDTA} are an essential source of ideas to formulate and prove
synthesis results for antagonistic and probabilistic environments against
specifications given by \acp{PBA}. Most notably, we obtained decidability
results for the following problems:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given a specification as almost-surely accepting \ac{PBA}. Compute a
    deterministic algorithm that \emph{always} satisfies the given
    specification or prove that such an algorithm cannot exist.
  \item Given a specification as almost-surely accepting \ac{PBA} and a
    \ac{POMDP}. Compute a determinisitc strategy such that almost-all
    executions under this strategy satisfy the posed specification or prove
    that such a strategy cannot exist.
\end{enumerate}
