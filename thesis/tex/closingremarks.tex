Concludingly, we investigated probabilistic alternating tree automata which
prove a very interesting topic. On the one hand, \acp{WDTA} induce a rich and
complex theory which includes various other probabilistic models. On the other
hand we obtained interesting results for synthesis problems which are inspired
by constructions of \acp{WDTA}.
