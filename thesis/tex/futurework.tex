Naturally, the complex theory of \acp{WDTA} cannot be thoroughly explored in
all its facets in the limited scope of this thesis. For various restricted and
the unrestricted classes there are open questions about closure properties and
expressiveness.

We want to examine the non-deterministic choices of \acp{WDTA}. Considering a
given tree $t$, then we can adapt Definition \ref{def:acceptancegame} to design
an acceptance game as \ac{MDP} with states $Q\times D^{*}$ where \eve{} decides
which transitions to take. Unfortunately, it is not immediate to obtain an
emptiness game from this construction as it is explained in Example
\ref{ex:alternatingtreeemptiness}. Giving \eve{} control of the tree and the
run entails that she must construct a consistent tree but depending on the
current state might choose different transitions. This induces requirements on
the observations of \eve{} which are not fitting the concept of partial
observability as discussed in this thesis. Therefore, we propose to consider
co-operative \acp{POSG} where e.g. \eve{} constructs the tree while \adam{}
complementarily builds an associated tree. The game is won for both players if
almost-surely or positively the acceptance condition of the associated
\ac{WDTA} is satisfied. This approach allows to use the different observations
for both players to obtain a consistent tree and a run for this tree which
utilizes the complete expressiveness of \acp{WDTA}. Additionally, we want to
note the following: for zero-sum \ac{POSG} once a strategy for one player is
fixed the other player might consider the game as \ac{POMDP}
\cite{AlgorithmsForPOSG}. For such a \ac{POMDP} non-randomised strategies are
as powerful as randomised strategies but for zero-sum \ac{POSG} even for
B端chi-conditions this is no longer true \cite{RandomnessForFree}. This argument
might be interesting since it is unclear how to obtain an associated tree from
a randomised strategy (given this argument translates to co-operative
\ac{POSG}).

It is also possible to use non-deterministic choices in other probabilistic
automata, e.g. \acp{PBA}. This yields an automaton which upon reading a
letter chooses non-deterministically a probability distribution which
determines its next state. This model subsumes $\omega$-regular languages by
using the non-determinism to choose from Dirac distributions (for both positive
and almost-sure semantics) and includes the properties of \acp{PBA} with
positive or almost-sure semantics respectively. Initially, since
non-determinism is sufficient to use B端chi-conditions for all $\omega$-regular
languages this raises the questions if this holds in the probabilistic case as
well. Analogously to \cite[Theorem 1.10]{AutoLogInfGames} we obtain an
equivalent \ac{NBA} for a given \ac{NPA} by introducing for every winning
parity a copy of the automaton which lacks transitions to higher odd parities
and marking in this copy the states with the associated winning partiy as
B端chi-states. Hence, the \ac{NBA} guesses the moment from which on no higher
odd parity is visited anymore and moves into the \enquote{correct} copy. An
immediate translation of this construction to the probabilistic case does not
work for the almost-sure case: the probability of loosing runs in a
probabilistic word automaton with Parity-condition and almost-sure acceptance
might diminish constantly for a winning run. Nevertheless, a movement into one
of the copies for a winning parity occurs after finitely many steps. Therefore,
there might be no situation after finitely many steps for such a movement which
does not allow for a measurable set of \enquote{failing} runs. In
\cite{RandAutoInfTrees} the \emph{value} of a tree $t$ in an automaton
$\mathcal{A}$ is defined as the supremum of the measure of all accepting paths
over all possible runs of $\mathcal{A}$ for $t$. This notion can be used here
as well and our construction suggests that the value of $\alpha$ is $1$ in the
B端chi-automaton if and only if it is accepted by the original probabilistic
automaton with Parity-condition.

Concludingly, we expect interesting results on the topic of \acp{WDTA} from
further investigation of co-operative \ac{POSG} which might be used as
emptiness games for \acp{WDTA}. Also, the further study of \acp{WDTA} might
reveal new connections to \acp{POSG} as well. Additionally, we propose to
consider automata with non-determistic as well as probabilistic choices.

Moreover, considering the presented synthesis results it is a natural way next
step to develop a logic to express the specification which can be translated to
almost-surely accepting \acp{PBA}. This is an important step since constructing
almost-surely accepting \acp{PBA} for languages directly is rather complex and
therefore unpractical. A first step for probabilistic word automata with
Muller-conditions is taken in \cite{ProbAutoProbLog}.
